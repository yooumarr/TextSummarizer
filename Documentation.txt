1. Installed conda and python 3.10.18 with it.

2. Set up hugginfaceapi token and used HuggingFaceEndpoint to have a inference endpoint. 

3. Faced issues in inference using a token so I switched t using pipeline from transformers and then wrapping it up in HuggingFacePipeline

4. I am using facebook/bart-large-cnn' to summarize my texts. 

5. Using HuggingFacePipeline I've built a pipeline that will use the model and kind of wrap it with a wrapper provided by HuggingFacePipeline to make it LangChain compatible.

Model Performance:
Input: It’s not obvious that gravity should be related to space and time, let
alone that seeking to describe it in a scientific theory might lead one to
contemplate the beginning and end of time. Black holes take centre stage in
exploring this deep relationship because they are gravity’s most extreme
observable creations. They are so intellectually troublesome that well into
the 1960s many physicists felt that while black holes are a feature of the
mathematics of general relativity, Nature would surely find a way to avoid
creating them. Einstein himself wrote a paper in 1939 in which he
concluded that black holes ‘do not exist in physical reality’.2 Einstein’s
illustrious contemporary Arthur Eddington put it in rather pithier terms:
‘There should be a law of Nature to prevent a star from behaving in this
absurd way.’ Well, there isn’t, and they do.

Output: Black holes are gravity’s most extremeobservable creations.

6. Next, I will use Flask to create a basic web app to accomplish the same summarization feature but through a UI.
7. The Flask UI is working fine and the model outputs the summary correctly.
